      "description": "<p><strong>What is ReturnBear?</strong></p>\n<p>Retail returns suck. We all hate packing, printing, and shipping unwanted items only to wait weeks for a refund. Retailers have it rough too. They have to figure out what has to be re-sold, refurbished, or recycled, and if they don't figure it out fast enough, they might as well send everything to a landfill. Nobody wins.</p>\n<p>This is why ReturnBear exists. We are Canada's first end-to-end reverse logistics solution. Our nationwide drop-off network means immediate exchanges and returns with no re-packing. We sort and QA goods to get inventory back to merchants fast, giving retailers 20%+ savings and making consumers happier. We make returns easy for everyone and better for the planet.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></p>\n<ol style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Redefine reverse logistics.</strong> We are pioneering how reverse logistics should be done and are backed by large players like Cadillac Fairview and the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan. Join us to set the standard.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Reduce carbon.</strong> As much as 30% of retail goods sold are returned. And when retailers can't figure out how to make the process efficient, it becomes easier to just chuck items into landfill, create waste, and unnecessarily shipping goods across the country, adding to more emissions. By joining ReturnBear, you are not only solving a clear pain point, you're also helping the environment.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Wildly improve customer experiences.</strong> Returns and exchanges can be better. They can be simple. They can be fast. They can be cost-effective. Help us design a new solution standard where customers can enjoy the peace of mind of knowing that their returns and exchanges can be handled instantly, while merchants get products back ready to resell faster than ever before.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>\n<p>We're looking for a <strong>Senior Product Manager</strong> to help define and execute the roadmap for ReturnBear's suite of reverse-logistics products and solutions. In this role, you'll:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Collect quantitative and qualitative feedback from our customers, sales, and internal team members in order to define the right problems to solve</li>\n<li style=\"\">Contribute to defining product priorities based on ReturnBear's strategy, user and market research, and data\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\">Build experiences for our Merchants, Consumers, Partners and our internal Operations team that makes returns simpler and better for everyone</li>\n<li style=\"\">Define requirements and collaborate with Engineering, Design and Partners to translate complex user problems into simple, user-friendly solutions\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\">Together with the Head of Product, define/prioritize problems and set outcomes/goals for the team, and ensure key product metrics are achieved against ReturnBear's objectives\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\">Lead by getting products and features shipped including customer-facing release communications, internal UAT testing, customer pilots, onboarding flows, and internal enablement</li>\n<li style=\"\">Be a thought leader and share ideas through publications, case studies or any related product marketing initiatives to position the product value to the market</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">5+ years of relevant experience in software product management, ideally in B2B SaaS, Retail/CPG Tech or Logistics Technology working as a part of an agile product methodology alongside engineering and design teams</li>\n<li style=\"\">You thrive in ambiguous, fast-paced environments, and can easily context-switch between writing merchant-facing user stories, interviewing customers, jumping on a partnership call, and whiteboarding user flows for a new consumer experience\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\">You like to keep a pulse on technology, industry, market and competitive landscape to inform your product prioritization</li>\n<li style=\"\">You're comfortable operating in a technical environment, making informed data decisions or sometimes lack thereof</li>\n<li style=\"\">You understand the levers you have at your disposal to protect the project and deadlines</li>\n<li style=\"\">You are willing and able to travel across North America on a regular basis</li>\n<li style=\"\">Bonus if you have knowledge of Canadian retail, e-commerce, reverse logistics, supply chain, and related technology solutions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What we look for</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Ownership mentality.</strong> \u201cIt's their problem, not mine\u201d doesn't have a place here. You own the problems and challenges that you see, and proactively work with your colleagues to turn them into opportunities. We're in it together!</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Growth mindset.</strong> You learn from your mistakes and believe in human potential. It's not that you can't overcome the challenge you're facing, it's just that you haven't overcome it yet. You appreciate the diverse thoughts and perspectives of your colleagues, partners and clients, and you are committed to actively listening and learning.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Getting things done</strong>. You are keen to do great work, and ship things often. \u201cDone is better than perfect\u201d might be something you believe in, and while you always strive to deliver what is best for you and your team, you realize that sometimes you'll have to circle back on it to iterate and make improvements.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Flexibility and comfort in ambiguity</strong>. You embrace the agile nature of design and development, and you are equally comfortable pivoting your plan and process as you are establishing a workback schedule. Try as we might, things won't always go as planned, and you always try to be ready to deal with that as it comes.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Passion for the problems we're solving</strong>. You understand how ecommerce and retail ecosystems are growing with emerging brands and solution providers, and you're keen to make an impact not just on the lives of customers, but on the businesses of our merchant partners and on the environment as well. Together we can save merchants and their customers time and money, AND we can help keep returns out of landfills.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Our Commitments</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Diversity and inclusion</strong>. We encourage applications from all qualified candidates regardless of their background, sexuality, physical abilities and ways of self-identification.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Honing your craft, your way</strong>. We provide the opportunities to develop your skills and knowledge. We work collaboratively and flexibly, with opportunities to shape a hybrid working style suited to your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope you're as excited by ReturnBear as we are, and look forward to chatting!</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1579182/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"

A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A\u00b7Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A\u00b7Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;\">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span>\u00a0sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters.

CRIO has achieved the attached metrics, all with little to no serious outbound sales or marketing.</p>\n<p>In 2022, CRIO released its Reviewer product, a separate application that allows third parties to review, query, lock, medical code and extract source data collected in eSource. Reviewer is a flexible application that CRIO plans to commercialize with its own site networks, with third party vendors (e.g., overnight EDC entry services), and with sponsors and CRO\u2019s as either a remote monitoring tool OR a full EDC solution. This innovative architecture is truly groundbreaking, and offers a new vision for how sponsors and CRO\u2019s can drive quality and efficiency.</p>\n<p>Budget Designer</p>\n<p>The role of the Budget Designer is to build out budget templates within the Clinical Research IO (CRIO) platform.

A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A\u00b7Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A\u00b7Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A\u00b7Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>How to apply:</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Go here:\u00a0<a href=\"https://build.a.team/remotivereferral\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://build.a.team/remotivereferral</a>\u00a0+ mention Remotive.\u00a0</span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short.

Our team is 70 people and growing. We\u2019re transforming the online community space. Our product powers a substantial segment of successful online communities, with &gt;30,000 Discourse instances globally. We have thousands of paying customers, with a growing number of Fortune 500 companies on our list, alongside many leading players in the fast-growth technology, gaming and blockchain/web3 spaces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are looking for candidates within the Americas. Timezones encompassing UTC -5 &gt; UTC -8.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>About the job</strong></p>\n<p>Software Engineers at Discourse are generalists. Some days you may be working on a complex JavaScript feature implemented in Ember.js. Other days you may be working on our Ruby on Rails API server. Some days you may be contributing patches to frameworks or working on one of the many gems and libraries Discourse maintains.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The majority of the work you will do will be open source.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Discourse is primarily a hosting company: some of your focus will be around improving our hosting infrastructure, resolving issues for customers, or assisting with customer-specific implementations and migrations.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Applicants will have a 10-40 hour paid trial project (over 2-10 weeks) prior to joining the team. The trial project usually involves adding a feature to Discourse or a Discourse plugin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Your responsibilities will include:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicate daily with clients and work with them to agree on work priorities</li>\n<li>Implement and document client features</li>\n<li>Discuss and decide with internal Discourse teams whether features are appropriate in core, or in client plugins</li>\n<li>Maintain client-specific features against latest core versions</li>\n<li>Highlight new critical core features to high-profile clients</li>\n<li>Schedule and deploy patches and upgrades</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>We\u2019re looking for someone who:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Has some Ruby and JavaScript experience</li>\n<li>Is passionate about open source and comfortable with public code reviews</li>\n<li>Has a knack for implementing processes, technologies, and solutions for a fast-paced environment.</li>\n<li>At Discourse, the ability to communicate well in writing is paramount. We use our own software, Discourse, for most communication and most of your interaction with customers and team members will be in writing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order to live these values, we look for folks who are:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detail-oriented, proactive, and organized</li>\n<li>Able to make decisions quickly and communicate effectively</li>\n<li>Work well independently and remotely</li>\n<li>Kind to their co-workers</li>\n<li>Highly driven with an execution focus and a strong belief in our mission to make the internet a better place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>About our Pay &amp; Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that high-quality benefits make our team more effective. We\u2019ve been thoughtful about <a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/team#benefits\" rel=\"nofollow\">our benefits package</a> which includes a completely flexible schedule, 5 weeks of vacation per year, funding for a co-working stipend, and much more!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our Salary Framework is location and experience based and we\u2019re happy to provide a range up front. We also give every employee a stake in the success of the business, regardless of seniority or role. All full-time employees are eligible to receive equity options in the company as part of our equity incentive program.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lastly, we believe in having a welcoming workplace where people with diverse backgrounds and cultures can create something great together.

Since 2013, we\u2019ve been building a CRM \u00a0that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or complex UI. Our goal: double the productivity of every sales rep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our backend\u00a0<a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close\" rel=\"nofollow\">tech stack</a>\u00a0currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our\u00a0<a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger\" rel=\"nofollow\">TaskTiger</a>\u00a0scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented\u00a0<a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://developer.close.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">public API</a>\u00a0that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We love open sourcing our code and ideas on <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://github.com/closeio\" rel=\"nofollow\">our GitHub</a> and on <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://making.close.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Making of Close</a>, our behind-the-scenes Product &amp; Engineering blog.
